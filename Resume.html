       <h2>My personality type is: <strong> Logician</strong></h2><br>
		<p>Logicians’ gifts include rationality, innovation, and the ability to envision a better future – but they don’t just want to hear what makes them great. Logicians want to find real, meaningful answers to seemingly impossible problems that haunt their imagination.<br>Imaginative and curious, Logician personalities can find endless fascination in the workings of their own mind.<br>For Logicians, the best conversations are like brainstorming sessions, with plenty of room for unconventional thoughts and off-the-wall what-ifs.</p><br>
		<p>Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren’t afraid to stand out from the crowd.</p><br>
		<p>Logicians often lose themselves in thought – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People with this personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, their minds buzz with ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads.<br> From the outside, Logicians may seem to live in a never-ending daydream. They have a reputation for being pensive, detached, and a bit reserved. That is, until they try to train all of their mental energy on the moment or the person at hand, which can be a bit uncomfortable for everyone. But regardless of which mode they’re in, Logicians are Introverts and tend to get tired out by extensive socializing. After a long day, they crave time alone to consult their own thoughts.</p><br>
